## Predictive Modeling

#### [Subsemble: An Ensemble Method](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778462)

Key Quote: 
> Subsemble partitions the full dataset into subsets of observations, fits a specified underlying algorithm on each subset, and uses a clever form of V-fold cross-validation to output a prediction function that combines the subset-specific fits. We give an oracle result that provides a theoretical performance guarantee for Subsemble.
