Random Effects and penalized splines are the same thing - Tristan Mahr

> The purpose of this post was to demystify the connection between penalized smooths and mixed effects models. Formally, it all boils down to a hyperparameter that penalizes model coefficients (or pools information) so that the model uses a smaller number of effective parameters. This connection enriches my understanding of the two kinds of models. A by-county random intercept is a category smoother. We can estimate a smooth by putting a prior on the variance of the basis function weights (provided that we incorporate the penalty matrix somehow). Itâ€™s wonderful.
