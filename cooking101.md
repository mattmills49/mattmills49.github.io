# Jambalaya 

### Ingredients:
- 1.5 lb chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 lb andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 2 stalks of celery, diced
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (or 2 vine tomatoes, chopped)
- 2.5 cups chicken broth
- 1.25 cups long-grain white rice
- 2 tbsp Cajun/Creole spice blend
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tbsp yellow mustard
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil
- Optional: chopped green onions and fresh parsley for garnish

### Instructions:

1. **Prep the Ingredients:**
   - Dice the chicken thighs, sausage, onion, bell pepper, and celery. Mince the garlic.

2. **Brown the Meats:**
   - Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
   - Add the chicken thighs, season with a pinch of salt, and cook until browned on all sides (about 5-7 minutes). Remove the chicken and set aside.
   - Add the sausage to the Dutch oven and cook until browned (about 3-4 minutes). Remove the sausage and set aside with the chicken.

3. **Cook the Vegetables:**
   - Add another tablespoon of oil if needed. Sauté the onion, bell pepper, and celery in the Dutch oven until softened (about 5-7 minutes).
   - Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

4. **Build the Flavor Base:**
   - Stir in the Cajun/Creole spice blend, dried thyme, and dried oregano. Cook for about 1-2 minutes to toast the spices.
   - Add the diced tomatoes (with their juices) and the yellow mustard. Stir well to combine.

5. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Return the browned chicken and sausage to the Dutch oven.
   - Pour in the chicken broth and stir to combine all ingredients.
   - Bring the mixture to a simmer.

6. **Cook the Jambalaya:**
   - Reduce the heat to low, cover the Dutch oven, and let it simmer for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
   - After 30 minutes, stir in the rice, ensuring it is evenly distributed.

7. **Slow Cook:**
   - Cover and cook on low heat for another 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom.
   - Check the rice for doneness. If the rice isn't fully cooked, add a bit more broth or water and continue to cook until the rice is tender.

8. **Final Touches:**
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
   - Let the jambalaya rest, covered, for about 10 minutes before serving.

9. **Serve:**
   - Garnish with chopped green onions and fresh parsley if desired.

Enjoy your homemade jambalaya with its rich, deep flavors enhanced by the slow cooking process!


# Ragú bolognese 

This ingredient list comes from The Food Lab but the book is still packed so I don't know the actual recipe lol I put one from ChatGPT at the end. 

- Ground veal, 1 lb
- Ground pork, 1 lb
- Ground beef, 1 lb
- Pancetta, 4 oz
- 2 large carrots, diced (1 cup)
- 1 large onion, diced (1.5 cups)
- 3 celery stalks, diced (1 cup)
- Garlic cloves, 4, minced
- Dried oregano, 2 tsp
- Sage leaves, 1/2 cup chopped
- San mariano tomatoes, 28 oz
- Dry red wine, 1.5 cups
- Whole milk, 2 cups
- Chicken stock, 2 cups
- Gelatin, I packet
- Bay leaves, 2
- Fish sauce, 1 tbsp OR (0.5 soy sauce + 0.5 tbsp Worscheshire sauce)
- Olive oil, 2 tbsp
- Butter, 4 tbsp
- Heavy cream, 1/2 cup
- Parsley and basil, 1/2 cup
- Parmesan, 2 oz

Recipe from ChatGPT:

Instructions:
1. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely diced carrots, celery, and onion. Cook and stir for about 10-15 minutes or until the vegetables are soft and translucent. This is the soffritto, the base of the sauce.
2. Add the minced garlic and continue to cook for another 2 minutes, being careful not to brown the garlic.
3. Increase the heat to high and add the ground beef and pork to the pot. Break the meat apart with a wooden spoon and cook until it's browned and well-browned. This should take about 15 minutes. Ensure any liquid released by the meat has evaporated.
4. Pour in the red wine and allow it to simmer for a few minutes, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
5. Add the San Marzano tomatoes (crushed by hand) and their juices to the pot. Stir well and bring the mixture to a simmer.
6. Reduce the heat to low and add the bay leaf, fresh basil, thyme, and sage. Stir and cover the pot. Let it simmer gently for at least 2 hours, or up to 4 hours, stirring occasionally.
7. After the sauce has simmered for the desired time, remove the herbs (bay leaf, basil, thyme, and sage sprigs).
8. Stir in the butter and whole milk. This will add creaminess to the sauce.
9. Season the Bolognese with salt and black pepper to taste.
10. Just before serving, stir in the freshly grated Parmesan cheese, which will give the sauce a nice umami flavor.
11. Serve the Bolognese sauce over your favorite pasta, such as tagliatelle or pappardelle, and garnish with more Parmesan cheese if desired.
