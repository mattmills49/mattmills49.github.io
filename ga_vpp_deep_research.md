Promoting DER and VPP Adoption in Georgia: Opportunities and Challenges

Introduction

Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) – such as rooftop solar panels, home battery storage, smart thermostats, and EV chargers – are transforming how electricity is generated and consumed at the local level. By networking many DERs together, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) can provide grid services like a traditional power plant, improving reliability and reducing peak demand. Georgia’s energy landscape is beginning to explore these innovations, but significant gaps remain in awareness, policy support, and utility programs. This report examines the current state of DER and VPP efforts in Georgia, identifies policy and regulatory barriers, and outlines strategies (including partnership opportunities and program design considerations) to accelerate DER/VPP adoption for residential customers (with some applicability to commercial/industrial users). We also draw lessons from other states that Georgia can learn from in unlocking the benefits of DERs and VPPs.

Existing Georgia Initiatives and Organizations Supporting DERs and VPPs

Georgia already has a number of organizations, programs, and pilot efforts that a new community organization can leverage or partner with:
	•	Georgia BRIGHT Program (Low-Income Solar Coalition): In 2024, a coalition led by the nonprofit Capital Good Fund (with partners including Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and the cities of Atlanta, Savannah, and Decatur) won a $156+ million federal grant to expand solar access for low- and moderate-income Georgians ￼ ￼. The resulting Georgia BRIGHT initiative offers discounted solar leases (and even some free installations) so that homeowners pay no upfront cost and see immediate savings ￼. According to the project description, this program will “accelerate clean energy adoption, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create good jobs, and alleviate energy burdens” in disadvantaged communities by rolling out single-family solar leases, free solar for extremely low-income households, and a novel community solar benefit program ￼. This coalition is a prime example of an effort to raise awareness and adoption of DERs (primarily rooftop solar) in Georgia, and it provides a template for community-driven outreach. A new organization could partner with Georgia BRIGHT or its members (like Southern Alliance for Clean Energy) to extend outreach and include battery storage or other DERs in their mission.
	•	Georgia Solar Energy Association (GA Solar): GA Solar is a statewide nonprofit that promotes solar energy through education and advocacy. They track and support programs that help residential and commercial customers save energy and money through solar and efficiency. For example, GA Solar highlights initiatives like the Georgia BRIGHT program, Commercial PACE financing for clean energy improvements, and federal grants for rural solar (REAP) ￼ ￼. Partnering with GA Solar could help tap into an existing network of solar advocates and industry experts, and they can assist in navigating policy discussions at the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) or legislature.
	•	Community Solarize Campaigns and Nonprofits: In metro Atlanta and other cities, community-driven bulk-purchasing campaigns (often called Solarize [City] programs) have successfully raised solar awareness. Groups like Georgia Interfaith Power & Light (GIPL), Environment Georgia, and local civic organizations have organized Solarize programs – for example, Solarize Atlanta in 2018 nearly doubled the city’s residential solar installations in under a year ￼. These campaigns educate homeowners, provide vetted installers with volume discounts, and often include options for battery add-ons. GIPL, in particular, engages faith communities and could be a valuable partner for outreach in neighborhoods and congregations interested in resilience and clean energy. GIPL has also helped congregations install solar panels (e.g. several Atlanta-area churches have gone solar with GIPL’s support) and advocates for equitable energy policies ￼. A new community organization could coordinate with such campaigns to include messaging about VPP participation – for instance, encouraging Solarize participants not just to install solar, but to enroll their new DERs in aggregation programs.
	•	Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE): SACE is a regional nonprofit active in Georgia that has been involved in DER advocacy and pilot programs. They have a long history of pushing for clean energy in the Southeast and were directly involved in the Georgia BRIGHT coalition. SACE’s Climate Advocacy Director heralded the recent Solar for All grant as a “historic, first-time ever investment… into solar energy access for residents with lower incomes” ￼. Beyond low-income solar, SACE monitors utility proceedings – their staff were part of negotiations that led to Georgia Power agreeing to pursue a VPP pilot (discussed below). Partnering with SACE can provide policy expertise, research, and credibility when engaging with regulators or the utility on issues like net metering, integrated resource planning, and VPP program design.
	•	Georgia Power & PSC Pilot Programs: While not widely implemented yet, Georgia’s regulators and its largest utility have started exploring DER aggregations. In Georgia Power’s 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) update, a **settlement (“stipulation”) was reached committing Georgia Power to develop a residential and small commercial solar-plus-battery pilot program to provide grid reliability and capacity benefits ￼. Georgia Power must work with stakeholders (likely including PSC staff and clean energy advocates) and file this program for approval in its 2025 IRP ￼. The envisioned pilot is 50 MW of customer-sited solar + storage aggregation ￼, essentially a utility-sponsored VPP demonstration. This development signals that Georgia Power is open to VPP concepts in principle. A community organization should stay close to this process – providing input on program design – and could position itself as a partner to recruit participants once the pilot launches. Additionally, Georgia Power already runs some DER programs for larger commercial customers under its “Resiliency” services. For instance, it offers a DER Customer Program where businesses with sufficiently large loads or generators can install on-site generation (or storage) and receive bill credits if Georgia Power can operate those resources for grid support ￼ ￼. These existing programs are focused on large assets (hundreds of kW or even multi-megawatt), but they show that the utility has a framework to contract with customers for using DERs. Extending a similar concept to residential scale (with many smaller resources aggregated to 50+ MW total) is the logical next step, and it’s exactly what the 2025 pilot aims to test. Georgia Power’s Smart Usage rates and load control programs (e.g. a smart thermostat program for air conditioning load reduction) also form a foundation of demand-side management that could evolve into a broader VPP.
	•	Local Government Initiatives: Several Georgia cities have clean energy goals that align with DER deployment. The City of Atlanta has committed to 100% clean energy by 2035, including a focus on behind-the-meter solar on city facilities and enabling community solar projects. Savannah and Decatur likewise have sustainability plans. In fact, Atlanta, Savannah, and Decatur are official partners in the Georgia BRIGHT coalition ￼, meaning they are helping advance solar in their communities through outreach and perhaps streamlined permitting. A metro-area community organization could coordinate with city sustainability offices – for example, doing joint workshops for residents on home energy technologies or advocating together for state policy changes (cities can lend a powerful voice in support of improved DER regulations). Additionally, Southface Institute (an Atlanta-based nonprofit) works on green building and resilience and has helped set up “solar + storage resilience hubs” in Atlanta communities ￼. Partnering with such efforts can demonstrate the tangible benefits of DERs (like backup power during outages) to the public.

In summary, while “virtual power plant” is a new term in Georgia, there is a growing ecosystem of solar and clean energy advocates, low-income solar programs, and even emerging utility pilots that can be harnessed. Building alliances with these groups – from nonprofits (GA Solar, SACE, GIPL, Southface) to city governments and even Georgia Power’s own pilot program team – will be critical in avoiding duplicate efforts and maximizing impact.

A row of Georgia homes with rooftop solar installations. Community initiatives like Solarize programs and the Georgia BRIGHT coalition are helping more households go solar, which creates an opportunity to aggregate these distributed energy resources into virtual power plants. Engaging existing solar adopters and installers will be key to growing a grassroots VPP network.

Georgia’s Policy and Regulatory Barriers to DER Deployment

Despite recent progress, Georgia’s policy landscape has several barriers that hinder DER adoption and VPP participation. Key obstacles include restrictive net metering rules, cumbersome interconnection policies, and a utility market structure that limits third-party innovation. Understanding these barriers is crucial, since part of the community organization’s mission may involve advocating for policy changes to unlock DER growth. Below we detail specific state-level laws and regulations in Georgia that create challenges, and what changes could help:

Net Metering and Solar Compensation Limits

One of the most immediate barriers in Georgia is the lack of robust net metering or fair compensation for residential solar generation. Georgia Power’s net metering program was extremely limited – capped at 5,000 customers or 32 MW statewide – and that cap has been reached and not expanded ￼. For those first 5,000 solar customers, the utility provided monthly netting (essentially one-to-one bill credits at the retail rate for energy sent to the grid). However, all new rooftop solar installations now fall under a much less favorable policy often called “net billing.” New solar customers must pay the full retail rate for all electricity they consume from the grid, and any excess solar generation they export is credited at a lower avoided cost rate (around 6–7¢ per kWh) ￼. In other words, Georgia Power will pay ~6.7¢/kWh for solar output (roughly the cost the utility avoids by not having to generate that power), which is barely half of the typical retail rate that customers pay for grid electricity. This drastic reduction in credit value lengthens the payback period for solar panels, reducing the financial incentive for homeowners to invest in DER.

Moreover, the Georgia PSC in 2022 approved additional disincentives: “maintaining the cap on net metering” and imposing a $100 one-time interconnection fee on new residential solar hookups ￼. (Georgia Power had originally sought a $200 fee, citing the controversial “cost shift” argument, before the PSC settled on $100 ￼.) While $100 may not make or break a solar project, it sends a discouraging signal and adds to upfront cost. Perhaps more importantly, by not raising the 0.2% of peak demand cap on net-metered solar (5,000 customers was roughly 0.2% of Georgia Power’s customer base), the PSC left Georgia with one of the most restrictive net metering policies in the nation. For context, South Carolina (another Southeast state with a traditionally regulated monopoly utility structure) initially had a 2% cap – ten times larger – and even that was lifted in 2019 by the Energy Freedom Act ￼ ￼. Georgia’s cap, by contrast, equated to roughly 0.2% of peak load ￼, which was quickly hit by enthusiastic early adopters (even without additional state incentives). The failure to expand this cap in subsequent proceedings means the next wave of would-be solar homeowners get substantially less credit for their energy. A coalition of solar advocates and some legislators have been pushing to improve net metering – for example, by proposing bills to raise the cap or require more competitive solar buyback rates – but so far no state law has mandated changes, leaving it to the PSC and utility. Policy change needed: To accelerate DER adoption, Georgia could emulate neighbors by expanding or eliminating the cap on net-metered customers, or implementing a modern “net billing” tariff that compensates exported energy at a higher rate during peak periods. Even if full retail net metering isn’t politically feasible, a time-of-use based export credit (valuing solar more during high-demand hours) or a feed-in tariff for aggregated DERs could improve project economics. At minimum, removing arbitrary participation caps (and allowing systems larger than the current 10 kW residential / 250 kW commercial limit to receive credits ￼) would allow the pent-up demand for rooftop solar to be met. The community organization can help by educating the public and decision-makers on how a larger distributed solar program can benefit all ratepayers (for instance, reducing need for expensive peak power) and by dispelling the “cost shift” myth with evidence from other states where higher solar penetration has had minimal impact on non-solar customers when programs are properly designed.

Interconnection Standards and Local Zoning Restrictions

Even aside from net metering, interconnection procedures and local permitting can pose hurdles for DER deployment in Georgia. While the technical standards for connecting small solar generators to the grid are well-established, the process can be slow or opaque. Georgia does not have a standardized statewide fast-track interconnection rule for small DER (some states have adopted streamlined processes or an online portal for systems under a certain size). Instead, each utility (or EMC co-op) may have its own requirements. Georgia Power, for instance, now requires that new solar installations (and especially batteries) have proper metering configurations so that it can measure any exports (to enforce the net billing regime). The newly approved $100 interconnection fee mentioned above adds a minor financial hurdle, but more importantly, unclear rules around battery storage integration could hamper VPP growth. For example, if a homeowner adds a battery to an existing solar system, it’s not yet clear in Georgia how the export of battery power (charged from solar) will be treated – current tariffs were designed mainly for solar PV. Policy change needed: The Georgia PSC could establish updated interconnection standards specifically covering energy storage and mixed DER, ensuring that as long as safety standards (UL listings, IEEE 1547, etc.) are met, utilities cannot delay or charge excessive fees for connecting DERs. Additionally, rules that allow meter aggregation or multiple meters at a site (for instance, if a community battery or EV charging hub is installed in a neighborhood) could facilitate creative VPP setups. The community organization might work with technical experts (e.g. at Georgia Tech or NREL) to propose an Interconnection Roadmap for Georgia’s distribution utilities ￼, identifying any outdated practices that need updating as DER penetration grows.

On the local level, zoning and homeowner association (HOA) rules have historically created barriers to rooftop solar – though recent changes have improved the situation. Georgia enacted a Solar Access Law in 2007 that prevents HOAs formed after that date from outright banning solar panels on homes ￼. This law affirms homeowners’ rights to install solar collectors for “reasonable use” on a detached single-family residence. However, a loophole allowed HOAs to still impose aesthetic restrictions, such as requiring panels to be on the rear-facing roof or not visible from the street ￼. In many cases, the north or rear roof gets less sun, effectively deterring solar installations or rendering them economically unviable. Until recently, HOA boards could even fine homeowners for installing panels against community covenants, and some homeowners faced threats of fines up to $50,000 in legal disputes over solar access ￼. The good news is that in early 2022 the Georgia Supreme Court issued a ruling that strengthened solar rights: the state now clearly protects a homeowner’s right to install solar panels on their property, even on front-facing roofs, so long as the placement is needed for “reasonable use” (i.e. to get sufficient sunlight) ￼. HOAs can still suggest alternate placements, but they cannot prohibit solar installations or mandate an impractical location that would severely reduce energy output ￼ ￼. This was a significant victory – given about a quarter of Georgians live in HOA communities ￼ – as it removes a hidden barrier for many suburban homeowners who may have wanted solar but were previously blocked by neighborhood rules. Moving forward, the community organization should be aware of this ruling and help educate both homeowners and HOA boards about it. In some cases, HOAs simply aren’t up to date on the law; providing them with the legal text (as in the proposed HB 483 (2021-22) or HB 1321 (2023-24) which sought to codify these protections ￼ ￼) can prevent conflicts. Additionally, working with local governments to promote solar-friendly zoning – for instance, ensuring that historic preservation districts or other special zones have guidelines that accommodate solar panels and battery enclosures – will smooth the path for DER adoption. Counties and cities can also simplify permitting for rooftop solar and storage (some have moved to online permit applications and standard templates for solar, which reduce installation lead times and cost).

In summary, Georgia needs to modernize its interconnection and permitting frameworks to align with a DER-rich future. Clear, uniform standards (especially for solar+storage) and pro-solar access laws (preventing unreasonable HOA or zoning barriers) are critical. The community organization can serve as a watchdog and educator on these issues, helping DER users navigate the process and pushing for statewide improvements where needed.

Utility Regulation and Market Access Challenges

Perhaps the most fundamental barrier to widespread DER and VPP adoption in Georgia is the structure of the electricity market and utility regulations. Georgia is a vertically integrated monopoly utility state: Georgia Power (a subsidiary of Southern Company) is the only investor-owned utility serving most of the state, and it operates under the oversight of the Georgia Public Service Commission. The rest of the state is served by electric membership cooperatives (EMCs) and municipal utilities, which are not regulated by the PSC ￼. This setup has several implications:
	•	Limited Retail Competition: Unlike some states, Georgia does not have retail electricity choice or a competitive third-party energy market. This means an independent company cannot easily offer DER aggregation or VPP services to consumers without going through the utility. In many deregulated states or in regions with organized wholesale markets (like PJM or MISO), there’s a framework (thanks to FERC Order 2222 and similar rules) for third-party aggregators to bundle customers’ DERs and bid that capacity into the market. Georgia, however, is not part of an RTO/ISO market – energy is dispatched by the utility and the Southern Company system, with no direct participation by outside aggregators. As a result, any VPP arrangement for residential customers must involve Georgia Power (or an EMC) as either the program operator or at least the approving entity. This can stifle innovation because utilities historically have been cautious in embracing customer-owned generation they don’t fully control. What needs to change: The PSC could encourage a more open model by explicitly allowing third-party aggregators to operate pilot programs or by requiring Georgia Power to accommodate aggregators. For instance, regulators in some states have directed utilities to develop tariffs for “prosumer” customers and aggregators – Colorado’s PUC suggested separate tariffs for residential and non-residential DER aggregation as part of its VPP exploration ￼. Georgia could explore a “VPP Tariff” or a standardized agreement where an outside entity (perhaps the community organization itself, or a partner company) can enroll customers and pool their DER capacity to provide services to the grid, with Georgia Power purchasing those services under an approved rate. Without such a pathway, any VPP will likely remain a utility-run program only.
	•	Utility Incentives and Business Model: Under traditional regulation, Georgia Power earns profits by investing in capital projects (power plants, transmission lines) and recovering costs plus a rate of return from ratepayers. DERs owned by customers challenge this model because they reduce the need for utility-built infrastructure. Unless Georgia Power is allowed to share in the benefits of DERs or even own a portion of them, it has a financial disincentive to encourage customer generation. We see this tension in the net metering debates – the utility citing “cross-subsidies” to limit rooftop solar growth ￼. To overcome this, regulators could implement performance-based incentives that reward the utility for integrating third-party DERs that save money. For example, if a VPP defers the need for a new substation upgrade or peaker plant, Georgia Power could earn a small performance incentive for facilitating that, aligning utility profit with DER proliferation. Another approach is allowing utility ownership of certain DER assets (as Georgia Power already does in some large commercial DER programs ￼ ￼) – though that can be a double-edged sword, as overreach could crowd out private installers. The community organization might advocate for a balanced policy where utilities earn incentives for programs that reduce system costs via DERs, and third-party providers get fair access to customers with appropriate consumer protections.
	•	Lack of State DER Targets or Requirements: Georgia does not have a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) or any state mandate for distributed generation. Renewable projects (mostly large-scale solar farms) have grown in Georgia largely due to economic trends and voluntary programs rather than a legal requirement. The state also hasn’t set energy storage targets as some states have. This means the policy driver for DER/VPP adoption has to come from demonstrating value rather than meeting a mandate. Other states offer a blueprint: California, for instance, is developing procurement targets for flexible resources like VPPs by 2028 ￼, and New York’s governor launched a proceeding to set VPP deployment targets as part of a “Grid of the Future” plan ￼. Georgia could similarly direct the PSC or utilities to identify DER potential and set goals (even if modest) for DER participation in resource planning. One concrete step would be integrating DERs explicitly into Georgia Power’s IRP modeling – i.e., treat “100 MW of aggregated rooftop solar+storage” as a resource option that can be chosen instead of a combustion turbine. This would highlight the grid value of VPPs on equal footing with traditional resources.
	•	Regulatory Support for Pilot Programs: As mentioned, Georgia Power’s upcoming 50 MW solar+storage VPP pilot is a major opportunity – but it will require PSC approval and careful design. The fact that the PSC Staff had to negotiate a stipulation for this pilot indicates that without pressure, the utility might not have pursued it. Continued watchdogging is needed to ensure the pilot isn’t quietly shelved or minimized. The community organization should be prepared to rally public comments at the 2025 IRP in support of the pilot and even push for expansion if it proves successful. Other states’ regulators have not been shy about mandating DER programs: “Maryland’s legislature enacted a law in 2024 requiring utilities to develop pilot programs to compensate DER owners/aggregators for grid support services, to be filed by mid-2025” ￼. Likewise, “Colorado’s PUC opened a proceeding and in 2024 ordered Xcel Energy to proceed with a VPP pilot (including procuring a Distributed Energy Resource Management System to manage it) ￼. These examples show that regulators can and do push utilities to act on VPPs. If Georgia’s pilot stalls or if adoption remains slow, the PSC (or legislators via law) may need to require full-scale programs. The community org can supply data and success stories from other states to bolster the case that Georgia should move faster on DER integration.

Finally, it’s worth noting that electric co-ops and municipal utilities (which serve many rural and some suburban parts of Georgia) present a mixed regulatory landscape. They are not under PSC jurisdiction, and their policies on rooftop solar vary – some offer no net metering or only wholesale-rate buyback, and few if any have considered VPP programs. However, co-ops are member-owned, which means there is an opportunity to influence them through community engagement. For example, if members of a co-op express strong interest in a demand response or solar aggregation program, the co-op board might launch a pilot. The community organization should therefore also do outreach beyond Georgia Power territory – sharing information on successful DER projects that co-ops have done in other states, like cooperative-led community solar farms or battery leasing programs. In short, Georgia’s utility structure is a barrier, but not an insurmountable one. With concerted advocacy, policy tweaks can be made to give DERs a larger role, and utilities can be shown that VPPs are an opportunity (for grid reliability and even new services) rather than just a threat to sales.

Designing an Attractive VPP Program with Georgia Power

For a virtual power plant program to succeed in Georgia – particularly one involving Georgia Power and targeting residential and small business participants – it must be structured in a way that appeals to customers while meeting grid needs. Simply put, households and businesses will only sign up their DERs (solar panels, batteries, smart appliances, EV chargers, etc.) to be aggregated if the value proposition is compelling and the terms are reasonable. Based on both common sense and the lessons from other VPP programs around the country, here are key components that a Georgia Power VPP agreement or program should include to attract participants:
	•	Financial Incentives and Fair Compensation: The program should offer clear monetary benefits, either through upfront payments, ongoing credits, or a combination. One approach is an upfront rebate or incentive for installing DER equipment that qualifies for the VPP – for example, North Carolina’s “Power Pair” program provides $0.36/Watt for solar plus $500 per kWh of battery capacity as an upfront incentive for participants ￼. Georgia Power could implement a similar rebate (perhaps using funds from existing demand-side management programs or federal grants) to buy down the cost of batteries or smart controls for customers who enroll. In addition, participants should receive performance-based payments or bill credits when their resources are called upon. For instance, California’s new Demand Side Grid Support program “compensates eligible customers for upfront capacity commitments and per-unit reductions in net load during grid events”, paying VPP aggregators for the kilowatts delivered which are then shared with participants ￼. Similarly, a Georgia Power VPP could pay customers a certain dollar amount per kW of capacity they pledge to make available (a standby payment), plus an energy payment per kWh actually discharged from their battery or curtailed from their load during peak events. As a benchmark, New Jersey’s proposed VPP demonstration offers an $8,000 to $16,000 incentive for an 8 kW home battery to participate, with any additional battery cost financed on-bill ￼ – a very rich incentive, but one that virtually guarantees strong uptake. While Georgia’s program might not be that generous initially, it should aim to meaningfully reduce payback times. Time-of-use (TOU) rate integration is another tool: customers could be put on a special TOU tariff with high peak prices and low off-peak prices so that they save money by letting the VPP discharge their battery at peak times (offsetting expensive energy). In Duke Energy’s Carolina VPP pilot, one cohort of customers stays on a TOU tariff and “retains complete control of their storage,” using price signals to guide when they discharge, while another cohort gives the utility direct control and in exchange gets an extra monthly bill credit ￼. Georgia Power might emulate this by offering a “VPP Rider” on top of a TOU rate – those who allow direct control get a fixed credit (say $20/month or more, depending on the size of their system), whereas those who prefer autonomy can simply time their usage to the price signals. Bottom line: the program must deliver real savings or earnings for participants – on the order of hundreds of dollars a year for a typical home – to justify any perceived inconvenience.
	•	Clear Terms on Control and Operations: A VPP program essentially involves customers allowing an outside entity (utility or aggregator) limited control over their equipment. The degree of control and the frequency/timing of control events should be clearly defined to avoid surprises. For example, the agreement might specify that during critical peak periods (say, 20 events per year, each up to 2 hours), Georgia Power or the VPP operator can discharge a homeowner’s battery to supply the grid, or adjust their smart thermostat by a few degrees to reduce load. In return, customers might be guaranteed that their battery will retain a minimum charge (so they still have backup power for personal use) or that they can opt-out of an event if absolutely necessary. Successful programs often build in such customer override options – but perhaps with a slight reduction in payout if used – to give participants peace of mind. The program should also clarify equipment ownership and maintenance: if Georgia Power installs any control device or software, is there a cost? (Ideally, any necessary communication device or switch is provided free). How will firmware updates or connectivity issues be handled? For commercial participants, terms like maximum demand reduction or load drop tests should be spelled out so they can plan around their operations. Ultimately, transparency and flexibility in the control scheme will make participants more comfortable. It’s also wise to start with an “opt-in” pilot: only customers who volunteer are enrolled, rather than any default or automatic enrollment.
	•	Data Access and Performance Monitoring: Both the participants and the program operator should have access to data that shows how the VPP is performing and how each customer’s contributions translate into savings. Customers will be more engaged if they can see, for instance, via a smartphone app or web dashboard, when their battery is discharging to support the grid, how much energy they contributed, and what bill credit they earned as a result. Providing this real-time or near-real-time feedback can make the program feel tangible and build trust that the utility is using their asset responsibly. Additionally, sharing aggregate performance data (e.g., “this community of 500 homes provided 5 MW during yesterday’s peak, helping avoid an outage”) can boost the sense of pride and engagement – the community ethos of a VPP can be a selling point. On the utility side, Georgia Power will require metering data from the DERs. The program should leverage advanced metering infrastructure (smart meters) which Georgia Power already has widely deployed, and possibly require participants to have a compatible energy management system or allow a small meter on the solar/storage system. Any data sharing should come with privacy protections and cybersecurity safeguards (these should be detailed in the program terms to allay fears about “Big Brother” watching one’s home energy usage).
	•	Participant Support and Guarantees: To make participation attractive, Georgia Power’s VPP program should minimize hassle for the customer. That means offering streamlined enrollment, perhaps with an energy concierge service to walk customers through the process, and integration with existing solar installers or device vendors. For instance, if a homeowner with an existing Tesla Powerwall or Enphase battery wants to join, the process should be as easy as signing a form or clicking an app – the utility/aggregator should handle the rest in the background (ensuring the device is enrolled in the dispatch software). Technical support should be available if something goes wrong (e.g., if a participant’s device isn’t responding to signals, the program operator should alert them and help fix it). Additionally, consider contract length and exit options: customers may be wary of long commitments. The program could allow opting out with notice (perhaps with the caveat of repaying a portion of an upfront incentive if they leave too soon). Offering a trial period or a one-year pilot commitment before any longer-term contract can also reduce barriers to signing up. Some VPP programs also provide a performance guarantee – for example, if a participant does everything right but the utility never calls on their resource in a given year, perhaps they still get a minimum bill credit for being available. Conversely, if the utility calls too many events beyond what was agreed, the contract might stipulate higher compensation. Defining these scenarios in writing protects both parties and builds trust.
	•	Integration with Existing Rates and Programs: Georgia Power already has demand response programs (like AC thermostat cycling) and renewable energy programs (like Green Energy purchases). The VPP design should ensure compatibility or even bundle these offerings. For instance, a household might be on a “Smart Usage” rate plan, have a solar array, and a smart thermostat – the VPP could combine all three into a single package so the customer isn’t juggling multiple programs. If done thoughtfully, a VPP could effectively supersede older demand response programs by encompassing them: e.g., instead of separately notifying customers to adjust thermostats and separately calling battery discharges, the VPP platform would coordinate all DER actions for maximum combined effect. The customer would then see a unified credit on their bill. Keeping it simple and unified is part of making it attractive.

In crafting these program components, Georgia Power and the community stakeholders should look at successful templates from other states and adapt them to Georgia’s context. For example, Hawaii’s new “Bring-Your-Own-Device” VPP program pays battery owners varying incentives based on the grid value of services and replaced an older Battery Bonus program ￼. Duke Energy’s Power Manager program in NC (for thermostats) and the new Power Pair (for solar+storage) show how to structure tiered incentives ￼ ￼. Georgia’s VPP pilot, if designed with these best practices, can provide a win-win: participating residents and businesses get financial rewards and backup power benefits, while Georgia Power gets a reliable peak-shaving and grid-balancing resource. The community organization can play a role by gathering input from potential participants (what do homeowners want out of such a program?) and presenting those findings to the utility/PSC. By advocating for a well-designed, customer-friendly program, the organization helps ensure that once launched, the VPP will actually attract widespread enrollment rather than languish due to poor terms.

Lessons from Other States: Policies to Unlock DER and VPP Growth

Georgia is not alone in facing the challenges of integrating distributed resources – across the country, states have been experimenting with policies and regulations to promote DERs and make virtual power plants a reality. Highlighting a few successful (or promising) examples from other states can inform Georgia’s path forward. Adopting or adapting some of these measures could significantly accelerate DER and VPP growth in the state:
	•	South Carolina – Lifting Caps and Enabling Solar Leasing: One of the most relevant examples is South Carolina, a neighboring state with a similar regulated utility structure. In 2019, South Carolina unanimously passed the Energy Freedom Act, a comprehensive solar law that “lift[ed] the state’s 2% cap on net metering, among many other pro-solar actions” ￼. At the time, utilities like Duke Energy had hit the 2% cap, and the cap was threatening to stall the rooftop solar market ￼. The law removed caps and locked in one-to-one net metering for several years, pending a move to new net metering plans after 2025 ￼. It also removed caps on solar leasing by third parties ￼, which had limited how many installations could use a leasing/PPA model. The result has been a more robust solar industry and continued growth in customer-sited solar in S.C. Georgia could learn from this by increasing or eliminating its own cap (as noted earlier) and ensuring that its 2015 solar financing law (which legalized third-party solar leases/PPAs up to a certain size) is expanded or at least not undermined. The bipartisan, job-growth framing that worked in South Carolina (“solar as a free-market opportunity” ￼) could similarly be used in Georgia to build political support for pro-DER legislation.
	•	North Carolina – Incentives Coupled with Time-of-Use Rates: In 2023, North Carolina’s regulators approved Duke Energy’s PowerPair program, a cutting-edge approach to foster residential solar-plus-storage and integrate those systems into grid operations. PowerPair offers upfront incentives (as mentioned, $0.36/W for solar and $500/kWh for storage) to 30 MW of capacity ￼. Uniquely, it created two customer options: one group stays on a Solar Choice TOU tariff (with peak pricing) and “retains complete control of their energy storage devices”, using price signals as their guide, while another group goes on a “bridge” flat tariff but “grants full control of their systems to the utility to use as part of a VPP in exchange for an additional monthly incentive” ￼. This dual-cohort design essentially tests customer-driven vs. utility-dispatched approaches under one program. Early indications are that customers appreciate having the choice. Georgia could replicate elements of this by pairing any new DER tariff with TOU rates and by perhaps piloting both an incentive-driven VPP model and a price-driven behavioral model to see which yields better results. North Carolina’s policy environment (also a vertically integrated utility state) shows that it’s possible to get buy-in from major utilities on such programs when they are part of a larger clean energy transition plan (NC’s was driven by legislation in 2021 requiring carbon reduction).
	•	California – Leveraging Grid Emergency Programs: California has been a leader in DER adoption, and more recently it’s pioneering VPP-specific incentives to enhance grid reliability during extreme events. In 2022–2023, after a series of grid emergencies (heat waves, wildfire-related outages), the California Energy Commission launched the Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) program. This program “compensates eligible customers for upfront capacity commitments and per-unit reductions in net energy load during extreme events,” allowing “third-party battery providers and other aggregators” to enroll customers and operate VPPs that deliver power or reduce load when needed ￼. Each participating site needs at least a 1 kW / 2 hour battery, and payments are made to the VPP operator based on how much capacity their aggregated fleet can reliably provide during called events ￼. The aggregator then shares those payments with customers per their contract. This model is essentially a flexible capacity market for DERs, and it has spurred companies to sign up thousands of home batteries into “virtual power plant” groups that respond when the grid is stressed. Georgia can observe how effective this is in avoiding blackouts and lowering peak prices. While Georgia doesn’t (yet) face California’s level of grid stress, the concept of paying for performance during critical peaks could be employed on a smaller scale (e.g., during hot summer afternoons in Georgia when air conditioning load soars). If Georgia Power’s IRP identifies a need for more peaking capacity, the PSC could approve an approach like California’s: pay aggregators (whether the utility itself or third parties) to round up a certain number of customers who will agree to have their batteries/export or thermostats adjusted during emergencies, and reward them for the actual load drop achieved. This is essentially a modern form of demand response, and California’s experience will provide a roadmap for program rules and verification methods.
	•	Hawaii – Grid Services from Customer Batteries: Hawaii has very high renewable energy penetration and has seen the retirement of its last coal plant, so ensuring grid stability through DERs has been crucial. The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission in late 2023 approved a Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) VPP program for Hawaiian Electric (HECO) ￼. This program replaced a short-term “Battery Bonus” and is designed to be long-lasting. It provides upfront incentives that vary depending on the location and service window (recognizing that not all grid needs are equal – e.g., an evening peak vs. overnight). At first, only energy storage systems are eligible (with a minimum capacity per site), but it may expand to other DERs later ￼. The BYOD model is particularly relevant: it means customers can use a variety of battery brands and vendors, as long as they enroll in the utility’s program and allow their battery to be dispatched during specific times. Georgia could consider a BYOD structure to encourage a competitive market of DER vendors. With BYOD, the utility doesn’t have to own or install every device – it simply sets the rules (through a tariff or contract) and verifies the performance. The key lesson from Hawaii is that when net metering was phased out, they replaced it with explicit grid service procurement from DERs. Georgia has effectively phased out true net metering; learning from Hawaii, it should replace the simple bill credit incentive with a more purposeful program that pays DER owners for specific services (capacity during peaks, frequency support, etc.). Doing so would help maintain DER momentum despite the end of net metering, much as Hawaii managed to keep customers installing batteries by offering them alternative compensation.
	•	Maryland and Colorado – Legislative Mandates for VPPs: Both Maryland and Colorado took strong legislative/regulatory action recently. In Maryland, the General Assembly passed H.B. 1256 in April 2024 directing the state’s investor-owned utilities to create pilot programs that “compensate owners and aggregators of DERs for distribution system support services,” with pilots to be filed by July 1, 2025 ￼. This law essentially forces the utilities to come up with VPP-style programs and signals legislative intent that DERs are now to be considered part of the utility toolkit. In Colorado, while legislation was considered, it was actually the PUC that stepped in: they opened a proceeding on VPPs and in April 2024 ordered Xcel Energy to issue an RFP for a DER management platform and encouraged the development of prosumer/aggregator tariffs ￼. Furthermore, Colorado’s legislature passed a law (S.B. 291 in 2023) that requires utilities to evaluate how customer-owned DER can contribute to resource adequacy and to remove barriers to their participation. The takeaway for Georgia is that top-down directives can jump-start VPP implementation. If the PSC (or legislature) clearly requires Georgia Power to roll out a full-scale VPP program (beyond a pilot) or to procure a certain MW from aggregated DERs by a target date, it will create a market signal for companies to develop offerings in the state. Right now, Georgia lacks that push – but seeing Maryland’s and Colorado’s progress, advocates could lobby for a similar directive. It might come in the form of a PSC integrated resource plan order or a bill in the Georgia General Assembly’s energy committee. Even a relatively small pilot requirement (say 50-100 MW, which Georgia is already looking at) with a report back on results can lay the groundwork for larger expansion.
	•	Virginia – Clarifying Battery Participation in Programs: An interesting small regulatory fix came from Virginia in 2024, where lawmakers passed bills (H.B. 1062 / S.B. 271) explicitly allowing customer-generators with on-site batteries to participate in utility peak reduction or demand response programs without losing their net metering compensation ￼. This was to resolve a potential conflict: previously, if a solar homeowner also enrolled a battery in a utility program, there were questions about how that interacted with net metering rules. The new law clarifies that as long as the customer is providing a distinct service (like grid demand reduction), they can get compensated for that on top of any net metering credits, rather than it being an either/or. While Georgia’s net metering is limited, this principle is important for designing VPP tariffs – it should be clear that customers can stack benefits. For instance, a Georgian with rooftop solar should still get whatever solar credits they’re entitled to and get paid for battery discharges that help the grid. Virginia’s example shows the value of fine-tuning regulations to eliminate ambiguities that could discourage participation. Georgia could preempt similar issues by updating its statutes or PSC regulations to explicitly support multi-program participation (ensuring, for example, that if a city of Atlanta homeowner is in the Georgia Power VPP pilot, they can also keep any solar renewable energy credits or local incentives without penalty).

In summary, other states provide a rich laboratory of ideas: removing caps, offering creative incentives, integrating time-based pricing, mandating utility action, and clarifying DER participation rules have all been used to boost DER and VPP growth. Georgia doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel – it can pick the best of these policies that suit its environment. For instance, starting with something like South Carolina’s cap removal and North Carolina’s incentive pilot would address immediate barriers and test the waters for Georgia. As the community organization, bringing these success stories to policymakers (through reports, meetings, public comments) will strengthen the case that these changes are proven and beneficial. It shifts the narrative from “DERs are a risky unknown” to “DERs are a well-tested strategy that many states are using to modernize their grid and economy.”

Local success story: Workers install a solar panel array on the roof of Trinity Episcopal Church in Statesboro, GA – one of the first projects completed under the Georgia BRIGHT initiative in 2024. The church’s solar array, visible to the community, demonstrates how DER projects can align with community values (in this case, faith stewardship of creation) and inspire broader adoption. Enabling aggregated control of such installations in the future could turn a collection of individual solar systems into a resilient virtual power plant serving Georgia’s grid. ￼ ￼

Additional Considerations and Hidden Barriers

In executing a plan to promote DER and VPP adoption, it’s important to anticipate not just the obvious hurdles (policy and economics), but also some technical, financial, political, and community-related factors that could impact success:
	•	Technical Integration and Grid Readiness: Georgia’s distribution grid will require upgrades and modern management to handle high DER penetration. Challenges like voltage fluctuations on circuits with lots of solar, or the need for advanced control systems (DERMS – Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems) to dispatch hundreds of devices, must be addressed. Georgia Power’s planning should include grid modernization investments – smarter inverters, upgraded transformers, communication networks – to ensure reliability as VPPs come online. Without this, utilities might invoke technical concerns to slow DER interconnections. The community should therefore support efforts in the IRP and grid investment plans to accommodate DER (and watchdog that “grid constraints” are valid and not overstated to block projects). On the flip side, VPPs aid the grid by responding faster than traditional power plants in emergencies – studies show new VPPs can be deployed within ~12 months, far faster than building new generation ￼, and can alleviate stress on transmission by serving local load. Communicating these benefits to grid operators will help get their buy-in. Lastly, standards and interoperability are a technical consideration: ensuring that different brands of solar inverters, batteries, and smart appliances can all communicate either with the utility or through a common aggregator platform is crucial. Open standards (like IEEE 2030.5 for DER communications) and testing programs will be needed so that a VPP isn’t locked into one vendor’s equipment.
	•	Financial Barriers for Consumers: The upfront cost of DERs (especially batteries) remains high for many households. Even with federal tax credits (30% ITC) and programs like Georgia BRIGHT for low-income residents, many middle-class consumers might struggle to afford a solar + storage system which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Financing solutions are therefore a key part of adoption. Georgia’s 2015 solar financing law allows third-party ownership, but more innovation is possible – for example, on-bill financing or battery leasing programs where customers pay little or nothing upfront and instead pay a monthly fee that is ideally offset by energy savings. Some electric cooperatives around the country have tried “no-money-down” battery offerings, recouping costs through shared savings; Georgia Power or EMCs could do similar, especially if the battery is enrolled in a VPP that generates revenue. The community org could also connect residents with information on rebates and federal programs (like the upcoming DOE “Home Energy Rebates” for efficient appliances and possibly batteries, which will be administered by Georgia Environmental Finance Authority) ￼. In addition, attention should be given to equity: without intentional programs, higher-income homeowners will benefit most from DERs, while lower-income and renters are left out. Expanding programs like Georgia BRIGHT and exploring community solar or community storage models (where renters can subscribe to a local solar/storage facility for bill credits) will be important to ensure broad community support and fairness. If DER adoption is seen as only for the affluent, it could provoke political pushback; showing that “DERs can reduce energy burdens in our most vulnerable communities” ￼ is a powerful counter-argument.
	•	Political and Institutional Resistance: Energy policy in Georgia can be politicized, and incumbent interests (the utility, fossil fuel providers, etc.) have considerable influence. The recent PSC decision to keep the net metering cap despite public outcry ￼ ￼ exemplifies how political leanings (concerns about cost shifts, a preference for centralized power plants, etc.) can override pro-DER sentiment. There may be “soft” barriers like skepticism among some regulators about the reliability of VPPs or pressure to protect utility revenues. Overcoming this requires persistent advocacy and education – bringing data to the table to show that, for instance, a 60 GW nationwide VPP deployment could save $15–$35 billion in infrastructure costs over 10 years while providing additional societal benefits ￼. While that is a national study, even a proportionate fraction in Georgia could translate to avoiding a costly power plant build. The community org should prepare easy-to-digest briefs for policymakers that bust myths (e.g., “rooftop solar raises rates” – when studies often show the cost impact is minimal at low penetration) and highlight bipartisan wins (jobs, resilience, consumer choice). It’s also crucial to engage allies: Georgia’s clean energy industry (solar installers, tech companies) can speak to the economic upside of DER expansion, and voices like military bases or corporate energy buyers can lend support (many large companies and Army bases in GA have renewable goals and could benefit from VPP structures for backup power). Politically, framing DERs/VPPs as enhancing grid security and resilience (keeping the lights on during storms, mitigating fuel price spikes) can resonate across the spectrum. Another political consideration is the PSC itself – Georgia PSC commissioners are elected statewide. Making DER promotion an election issue by informing voters and candidate forums could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment over time.
	•	Community Engagement and Education: Finally, a less tangible but very real barrier is general awareness and trust. Many consumers simply are not familiar with the concept of a virtual power plant or may not understand how their “small” solar panel or smart thermostat could play a role in the wider grid. There may also be mistrust: some might balk at allowing the utility to control their devices, fearing loss of autonomy or privacy. Overcoming this requires on-the-ground education and relationship-building. The community organization should host workshops, publish simple guides, and perhaps arrange demonstration projects. For example, setting up a neighborhood resilience hub with solar + storage in a public building can showcase how DERs function and provide tangible community benefits (like powering a shelter during outages) ￼. Success stories (like the Statesboro church solar project, or homeowners who saved money with their Powerwall during a peak event) need to be highlighted to build public enthusiasm. It’s also important to address any safety concerns upfront – for instance, lithium-ion batteries have a very small risk of fire; the organization can work with fire departments to educate them on DER installations and ensure codes (like spacing and ventilation for battery units) are followed, which will help avoid negative incidents that could sour public opinion. Engaging community leaders (faith leaders, neighborhood association heads) to champion DER projects can help normalize the technology. In short, community buy-in is as important as policy change. If people see DERs and VPPs as beneficial, modern, and aligned with Georgia’s values (such as self-reliance and innovation), they will support the movement and perhaps even demand these solutions from their elected officials and utilities.

Conclusion

Georgia stands at an energy crossroads: the state is experiencing economic growth and rising electricity demand, and it faces decisions about how to meet that demand reliably and affordably. Distributed Energy Resources and Virtual Power Plants offer a compelling part of the solution – empowering consumers to generate and manage energy, while collectively providing flexibility to the grid. This report has shown that although Georgia has been slower than some states to embrace DERs, the momentum is building through local initiatives, and clear steps can be taken to accelerate progress. By partnering with existing organizations, pushing for smart policy reforms (like better net metering, fair compensation, and pro-DER regulations), and ensuring any new VPP programs are attractive to everyday Georgians, a community-driven effort can significantly boost DER adoption. Other states’ successes provide a roadmap, but Georgia will need to tailor solutions to its unique context – working within a monopoly utility structure and engaging a broad range of stakeholders from urban Atlanta to rural co-op territories. Crucially, no single change will unlock DERs and VPPs by itself; a combination of education, advocacy, and collaboration is required. The potential rewards are great: more resilient communities during storms, utility bills that are lower or more predictable, new green jobs in installation and tech, reduced emissions, and giving families and businesses the ability to actively participate in the energy system. With thoughtful strategy and persistent effort, a community organization can help Georgia turn the promise of DERs and VPPs into a reality, fostering an energy landscape that is more distributed, democratic, and dynamic for years to come.
