# Estimating the Cost for Rooftop Solar in Dekalb County

My belief is that solar panels and batteries are rapidly becoming our best tool to fight climate change. No other technology has a better value proposition than collecting free energy from the sun and storing it to use when most needed. I can install solar on my roof and do my Small Part but I started to think about how to scale things up. What we really need is a big roof, and an organization that will be around for a while to reap the full cost benefits of installing solar panels on their roofs. I am proposing that we install solar panels on every roof of every government building in DeKalb County, where I am from. This will do three things:
1. Save the county, and it's residents, money on power usage 
2. Reduce the carbon emissions of the displaced power usage
3. Suppor the solar industry in GA to make it even cheaper to do the same thing in the next county

This blog post serves as a simple, like really really dumb, estimate of the cost of such a program. My hope is that this inspires other people to help me with the project so that we can turn these from estimates to concrete proposals and legislation. Lets dive in. 

The size of the Chamblee High School roof is 125k sq ft. I think the building is on average two stories so lets say it also has 250k sq ft of space. I found estimates from [2012][1] and [2018][2] that show High Schools and Education use between 10-16kwh per sq ft annually; lets take the average and assume our building uses 3,250MWh of energy per year (This is equivalent to about 325 homes). If we assume this power is spread evenly throughout the hours of the day then our school uses 371kWh of energy each hour. A 500W solar panel is estimated to be [27.5 sq ft][3]. If we assume that we can only dedicate 50% of the roof to rooftop solar then we can fit 2272 panels in our rooftop array. Since each panel is 500W this would have a capacity of 1136kW. During peak sun this would exceed the power needs of the building by nearly a factor of 4. We could either build only to this peak load capacity or build the full 1136kW capacity array and sell the excess power back to the grid. Solar Power in Atlanta is rated as getting [4.74 sun hours per day on average throughout the year][4]. This gives us a total power generated of ~1,965MWh annually. That is enough to completely power 196 homes, and importantly would replace 60% of Chamblee High School's energy consumption for the year. This would also offset [680 metric tons of CO2][5] each year! That is about 97 households worth of CO2 emissions form electricity usage. 

This system would cost $3.4M using an estimate of [$3.00/W][6]. However, utility scale solar is closer to $1.06/W; By purchasing at scale and potentially getting cheaper financing working through the county $3.00 is certainly an upper estimate. DeKalb County collected [$775m in tax revenue][7] in 2022. So for 0.44% of our annual budget we could provide carbon-free energy and reduce our energy costs for operating CHS. Or to put it another way there are 284k households in DeKalb County; if DeKalb County sold $100 bonds to pay for the cost of install we would only need 12% of households in the county to purchase a bond. At current energy prices of [$0.14/kWh][8] this would save $275k per year in energy savings assuming no power was wasted, and would take 12.5 years to pay back. If the net-metering rate from Georgia Power was not market prices (for residential customers it is only [$0.066/kwh][9]) then this would increase the pay-back time. Installing batteries along with the rooftop solar would increase the up-front cost but could potentially decrease the pay back time with on-peak net metering pricing like in California and lower CO2 emissions even further by reducing the peak demand of the grid as the sun is setting. 

There are many assumptions baked in to this analysis but the total impact will be on the magnitude of:
  * Free energy after 12.5 years
  * 680 metric tons of CO2 saved per year

DeKalb county has 18 high schools. The roofs are already there doing nothing right now. I think we should at least try to save money and the planet one roof at a time.
