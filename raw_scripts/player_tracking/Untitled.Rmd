This is the sample data for the Hawks - Knicks game on January 3rd

```{r formatting_explore}
library(rjson)
test <- fromJSON(file = "~/Documents/sample data/nba player tracking/0021500506.json")

event_lengths <- vapply(test$events, length, numeric(1))
```

Each event has 4 lists;

```{r}
names(test$events[[1]])
# "eventId" "visitor" "home"    "moments"
```

the `visitor` and `home` lists contain roster information

```{r}
names(test$events[[1]][[2]])
# "name"         "teamid"       "abbreviation" "players"   
```
